###Normal Distribution

####Normal Distribution

+ Unimodal and symmetric
+ Bell curve
+ Follows very strict guidelines about how variably the data are distributed around the mean
+ Many variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal
+ $N(\mu, \sigma)$

####68-95-99.7% Rule

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weijia2013/Duke-Data-Analysis-and-Statistics-Inference/master/Week%20Two%20Notes/sd.png)

**_68% Falls within one standard deviation of the mean $[\mu - \sigma, \mu + \sigma]$_** 

**_95% Falls within two standard deviation of the mean_ $[\mu - {2} \sigma, \mu + {2} \sigma]$**

**_99% Falls within three standard deviation of the mean $[\mu - {3} \sigma, \mu + {3} \sigma]$_**

####Standardised Scores ($Z$ score)

1. **_Standardised $Z$ score_** of an observation is **_the number of standard deviation_** it falls above or below the mean.

2. $Z = \frac{observation \ - \ mean}{SD}$

3. $Z$ score of mean = 0; $Z = \frac{mean \ - \ mean}{SD} = 0$

4. Unusual observaiton: $\left| Z \right| > 2$

5. Defined for distributions of any shape

####Probabilities and percentiles

1. When the distribution is normal, $Z$ scores can be used to calculate percentiles

2. **_Percentile_** is the percentage of observations that **_fall below a given data point_**

3. Graphically, percentile is the area **_below_** the probability distribution curve to the **_left of that observation_**.
