###Normal Distribution

####Normal Distribution

+ Unimodal and symmetric
+ Bell curve
+ Follows very strict guidelines about how variably the data are distributed around the mean
+ Many variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal
+ $N(\mu, \sigma)$

####68-95-99.7% Rule

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weijia2013/Duke-Data-Analysis-and-Statistics-Inference/master/Week%20Two%20Notes/sd.png)

**_68% Falls within one standard deviation of the mean $[\mu - \sigma, \mu + \sigma]$_** 

**_95% Falls within two standard deviation of the mean_ $[\mu - {2} \sigma, \mu + {2} \sigma]$**

**_99% Falls within three standard deviation of the mean $[\mu - {3} \sigma, \mu + {3} \sigma]$_**

####Standardised Scores ($Z$ score)

1. **_Standardised $Z$ score_** of an observation is **_the number of standard deviation_** it falls above or below the mean.

2. $Z = \frac{observation \ - \ mean}{SD}$

3. $Z$ score of mean = 0; $Z = \frac{mean \ - \ mean}{SD} = 0$

4. Unusual observaiton: $\left| Z \right| > 2$

5. Defined for distributions of any shape

####Probabilities and percentiles

1. When the distribution is normal, $Z$ scores can be used to calculate percentiles

2. **_Percentile_** is the percentage of observations that **_fall below a given data point_**

3. Graphically, percentile is the area **_below_** the probability distribution curve to the **_left of that observation_**.

`pnorm()` in R can calculate the probability of a given data point.

`qnorm()` in R can calculate the data point based on the give probability.


```{r}
pnorm(-1,mean = 0, sd=1)
```
###Evaluating the Normal Distribution

1. Data are plotted on the y-axis of a normal probability plot, and theoretical quantiles(following a normal distribution) on the x-axis.
2. If there is a one-to-one relationship between the data and the theoretical quantiles, then the data follow a nearly normal distribution.
3. Since a one-to-one relationship would appear as a straight line on a scatter plot, the closer the points are to a perfect straight line, the more confident we can be that the data follow the normal model.
4. Constructing a normal probability plot requires calculating percentiles and corresponding z-scores for ach observation, which is tedious.Therefore, we generally on software when making these plots.
5. Right skew points bend up and to the left of the line.
6. Left skew points bend down and to the right of the line.
7. Short tails (narrower than the normal distribution) Points follow an S shaped-curve.
8. Long tails (wider than the normal distribution) Points start below the line, bend to follow it, and end above it.
